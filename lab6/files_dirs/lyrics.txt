Sweetness
Sweetness, I was only joking when I said
I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Oh sweetness
Sweetness, I was only joking when I said
By rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt
Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place with the human race
Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place with the human race
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place with the human race
Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place with the human race
Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place with the human race
Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place with the human race
